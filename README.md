# Protocol Update - September 1, 2025

Starting from September 1st, 2025, the ACP team has chosen to join forces with Google's A2A protocol team to work on one unified protocol. You can read more about this collaboration here. Due to this merge, this course will only be available for a short period before being replaced with an updated A2A course.


# ACP Agent Communication Protocol Demo

This repository contains demo code and resources for the [Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/acp-agent-communication-protocol) short course by DeepLearning.AI.


## Overview

ACP enables seamless communication between AI agents, allowing you to build multi-agent systems that can collaborate, delegate tasks, and chain workflows. This repo demonstrates:

- Building RAG agents with CrewAI
- Wrapping agents in ACP-compliant servers
- Discovering and calling agents using ACP clients
- Chaining agent calls (sequential and hierarchical)
- Integrating Smolagents and MCP tools
